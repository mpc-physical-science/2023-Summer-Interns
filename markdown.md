# Markdown

From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown> (which is a good place to start):

>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor...

## Notes on Using Markdown
* If there is a list of items which need to be accomplished in order, use numbers to indicate thier order, this is known as an *ordered list*.
* If the order is unimportant (such as this list), than use bullet points to indicate each one. This is known as an *unordered list*.
* There can **only be one title** in a document, all other headings will be subtitles. Use the "*#*" to denote a title and subtitles, appropriately.
* Be sure to use *italics* for special terms and **bold-face** for something you would like to emphasize.
* To create a hyperlink, put the text description in "[]" and the hyperlink in "()", see **Reference Information** below for an example.
